Calendar Admin
---

Calendar Admin adds the ability to send requests to the administrators to have events added to the organization's Google Calendar, Meetup.com, and Eventbrite.

It allows you to generate a link to use for an "Add Event" button above your calendar, so your users can request to have events added to your calendars.

The user submits their request through an event request form.

Requests are approved or denied by calendar administrators via e-mail or the web interface.


### Project Facts
* Uses Python's Flask Web Framework with the Flask-Admin extension.
* Project is designed to be deployed on Heroku, but can be run locally (preferrably an Ubuntu/Debian server) by using "fab run".
* Uses SQLAlchemy (Flask-SQLAlchemy) as the ORM. Locally it uses SQLite, on Heroku it uses Postgres.
* OAUTH authentication with google calendar, meetup, and eventbrite made easier by Authomatic.
* Used https://github.com/albertogg/flask-bootstrap-skel for initial boilerplate.
* Admin interface is using the SB Admin 2 theme: http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/sb-admin-2/
* Email is handled using SparkPost.
* Alembic is used for database migrations.
* Uses Imgur's API for hosting location images and resizing. Thanks Imgur!

### Additional Facts About Database
* The models for the database tables are here: https://github.com/pawl/CalendarAdmin/blob/master/application/models.py
* The database tables are generated during the setup instructions (based on the models).
* You will need to be familiar with SQLAlchemy.
  * This guide is helpful for understanding how SQLAlchemy is used: https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-SQLAlchemy/queries.html
  * This guide is helpful for understanding relations: http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_9/orm/relationships.html

### Setup For Development
1. Run "pip install -r requirements/dev.txt" to install requirements.
2. Initialize the DB by running:
    ```
    $ fab shell
    >>> db.create_all()
    >>> exit()
    ```

3. You need to fill in some environmental variables to your etc/environment file:
 * SECRET_KEY - required by flask, see "How to generate good secret keys" on this page http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/quickstart/
 * DOMAIN_NAME - Get a domain. This is required for Google login.
 * DATABASE_URL - The "URL" field on the Connection Settings page for your Heroku Database.
 * GOOGLE_CUSTOMER_KEY & GOOGLE_CUSTOMER_SECRET
   * In the Google API Console (APIs section under APIS & AUTH), turn on Calendar API and Google+ API.
    * In the Credentials section of the Google API Console, click "Create new Client ID".
     * Application type: Web Application
      * Use http://www.your_domain.com:8080/login for the AUTHORIZED REDIRECT URI, leave the AUTHORIZED JAVASCRIPT ORIGINS as example.com.
      * GOOGLE_CUSTOMER_KEY  - Use "CLIENT ID"
      * GOOGLE_CUSTOMER_SECRET - Use "CLIENT SECRET"
 * SPARKPOST_API_KEY - Get an API key from the SparkPost settings page, also follow their instructions to set the appropriate DNS settings on your domain. This is required to send email.
 * IMGUR_ID - Log into imgur and go to https://imgur.com/account/settings/apps. You just need the client_id. This is for the images of locations.
 * ENCRYPTION_KEY - Any 16 or 32 characters. This is used for encrypting info in urls.
 * EVENTBRITE_CUSTOMER_KEY & EVENTBRITE_CUSTOMER_SECRET - Once you log into your eventbrite account, go to https://www.eventbrite.com/myaccount/apps/ and register your application. Use http://www.your_domain.com/subaccount_login/eventbrite for the OAuth Redirect URI.
 * MEETUP_CUSTOMER_KEY & MEETUP_CUSTOMER_SECRET - Once you log into your meetup.com account, go to https://secure.meetup.com/meetup_api/oauth_consumers/ and register your application. Use www.your_domain.com/subaccount_login/meetup for the OAuth Redirect URI.
4. To get image processing working for the locations view, you may need to apt-get some additional libraries: http://askubuntu.com/a/272095

Your etc/environment file should end up having these lines:
```
SPARKPOST_API_KEY='secret'
SECRET_KEY='secret'
DOMAIN_NAME='www.yourdomain.com'
ENCRYPTION_KEY='1111111111111111'
GOOGLE_CUSTOMER_KEY='secret'
GOOGLE_CUSTOMER_SECRET='secret'
MEETUP_CUSTOMER_KEY='secret'
MEETUP_CUSTOMER_SECRET='secret'
IMGUR_ID='aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa'
EVENTBRITE_CUSTOMER_KEY='secret'
EVENTBRITE_CUSTOMER_SECRET='secret'
```

### Setup For Production
* Set environmental variables on heroku:
 * heroku config:add PRODUCTION_SETTINGS='production_settings.py' SPARKPOST_API_KEY='secret' SECRET_KEY='secret' DOMAIN_NAME='www.yourdomain.com' ENCRYPTION_KEY='secret' GOOGLE_CUSTOMER_KEY='secret' GOOGLE_CUSTOMER_SECRET='secret' MEETUP_CUSTOMER_KEY='secret' MEETUP_CUSTOMER_SECRET='secret' IMGUR_ID='aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa' EVENTBRITE_CUSTOMER_KEY='secret' EVENTBRITE_CUSTOMER_SECRET='secret
  * heroku config:set PYTHONPATH='fakepath'
* https://github.com/albertogg/flask-bootstrap-skel#production-configuration

### TODO
* Improve styling on front page.
* Improve styling on requests page.
* Write unit test for requesting an event.
* Allow scheduling repeating classes (need to be careful not to let classes run indefinitely).
* Make the admin interface more user friendly by adding a more obvious button to create public urls for calendars.
* Only meetup/eventbrite: Prevent collisions of events for the same location and same time.
* Fix date fields on "Create Event" page. They can't share the same formatting as the request form without some changes to flask-admin.
