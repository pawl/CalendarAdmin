          <h4>Better than e-mail</h4>
          <p>No more questions about who to e-mail. Requests go into a "Pending" queue to prevent them from falling through the cracks.</p>

      <h4>Use your existing calendar</h4>
          <p>Your users are already subscribed to your current Google Calendar. This solution prevents the hassle of switching to something else.</p>

          <h4>Share the link</h4>
          <p>Calendar Admin provides a public URL which allows your users to request new events for your calendar. Put it on your calendar page!</p>

        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h4>Streamlined calendar management</h4>
          <p>Calendar Admin adds the features you need in order to effectively manage your Google Calendar with a team.</p>

          <h4>Pre-defined venues</h4>
          <p>Don't let your users get your address wrong. You can pre-define a list of venues for your "Request Event" form.</p>

          <h4>Multiple administrators, one calendar</h4>
          <p>Who can approve requested events? Anyone who has edit access to the shared calendar (you also need to log into the application at least once).</p>
